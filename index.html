It'd be incredibly disingenuous to regard immigration policy as anything less than an absolutely complicated issue. Every opinion and every argument holds the potential for merit, and as such, ideas need to be discussed and evaluated. As a western society, ideas are entirely free to breath and grow artificially. <br><br>
Unfortunately, even though all opinions have the potential to hold value, not all of them do. Furthermore, sometimes ideas that shouldn’t hold value surface to the top of the intellectual marketplace and become the prevailing philosophy of a society. Often this happens when political leaders play on the people’s collective anger, hopelessness, and fear as a means to usurp power. They employ divisive rhetoric.<br><br>
Rather than discuss the issues they find troubling, people are often tempted to combat hateful rhetoric with censorship. This often takes form in accusations of <i>racism, xenophobia, and misogyny</i> towards the opposition. Unfortunately, while these claims may be entirely valid, this only further convinces people already on your side, as they understand the position you play from. However your words fall deft on demographic you’re actually aiming (and furthermore need) to convince, the people split in the middle and ambivalent to the issue. Instead, they grow bored of your wordage and come to resent you.<br><br>
This is how Donald J Trump got elected. Whether you like him or not (and there’s a few fine folk who vehemently do not), a very strong argument can be made to say that he did not become to President-Elect on the merit of his ideas. Instead, he rose to power by playing on the ugly biases, frustrations, and ultimately the prejudice of the American people. He’s acting in his self-interest and the man who lusts for power merely happens to be an expert manipulator and entirely willing to put his talents to use.<br><br>
As a response to Trump’s arguably extreme ideas on the function of government and the actions it should execute, the Left chose not to speak on the merits (or lack thereof) of his ideas, and instead went the route of character assassinations, choosing to condemn him as a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, islamophobia monster, and in doing so, they failed entirely. The American people aren’t idiots and the choice became clear; they could either support the Censor, the Panderer, the incredibly patronizing Establishment or vote in someone who’s new, simple, and just as angry as them. Through this lens, it’s easy to understand why Donald Trump won the Electorate.<br><br>
It’s also even easier to understand that only way to stop any radical agenda he may have is to have an open and honest dialogue on the issues at hand and their solutions.<br><br>
The purpose of this site is to provide the content and evidence in opposition to any radical agenda he may have, specifically on the topic of illegal immigration. There will be no character assassinations - no attempts at censorship - no insults towards the opposition. I believe reason triumphs over anger, and all it takes for justice to prevail is to let the people observe the evidence and form their own conclusions.<br><br>
Make no mistake, I identify as a left-leaning libertarian. I am anti-Trump and I’m not pretending to be otherwise. That being said, the purpose of this forum is to persuade, not criticize. Lastly, while I do have an agenda, I will do my best to ensure my content is rooted in logic and reason and that my arguments are fair to the reality of the situation, and as such, well-documented. There will be sources for everything.<br><br>
Enjoy.<br>
